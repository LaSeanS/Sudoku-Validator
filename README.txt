My program reads a text file named "solution.txt" in order to execute properly. The "solution.txt" file must be in the same folder as the sudoku_validator.c file, and must follow the same format as the text file provided on Moodle. (a 2D 9x9 matrix of integers separated by spaces).

The command to compile and execute the program is:

gcc sudoku_validator.c -lpthread -o output.out

From here, you can print the output to the command line using:

./output.out
